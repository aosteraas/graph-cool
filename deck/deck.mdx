# But seriously what's the deal with GraphQL

<Squares />

---

# GraphQL

- J.A.F.F.I (est. 2012)
- Query Language (¿¡oh really!?)
- 🚂 Strong hype train 🚂
- Uses `Queries` a la `GET`
- and `Mutations` like `POST|PATCH|DELETE|ETC`
- More declarative than REST
- Better than SOAP in your eyes
- Big and unusual
- Has a lot of cool tools
- A new way of thinking

# But what does a controller look like then?

<Squares />

---

# Like this

<div style={{fontSize:`70%`}}>

```cs
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Post([FromBody] GraphQLQuery query)
{
    if (query == null)
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(query));

    var inputs = query.Variables.ToInputs();

    var executionOptions = new ExecutionOptions
    {
        Schema = _schema,
        Query = query.Query,
        Inputs = inputs
    };

    var result = await _documentExecuter.ExecuteAsync(executionOptions);

    if (result.Errors?.Count > 0)
        return BadRequest(result);

    return Ok(result);
}
```

</div>

# That's It

## One Controller, One Route

## Instead we define Schemas, Types, and Resolvers

<div style={{fontSize:`80%`}}>

```cs
// Query Example
FieldAsync<ListGraphType<CommentType>>(
    name: "commentsForUser",

    description: "All comments from a given user",

    arguments: new QueryArguments(
        new QueryArgument<NonNullGraphType<IdGraphType>>
            { Name = "userId", Description = "The User's Id" }
        ),

    resolve: async context => await locator
        .CommentRepository
        .GetImageComments(context.GetArgument<int>("userId"))
);
```

</div>
